# Merging your branch back in

Now that we've made some substantial changes, we want to share our recipes with the world! Or at least with our team. Let's see how we can merge our personal branch back in with the main branch, the *Master* branch.

On GitHub, the mechanism for doing this is a **pull request**, or a PR for short. A pull request tells the owner of the main branch that you're ready for them to merge your changes back in. This is when someone responsible for the project will approve your changes and **merge** them into the main branch.

> Merging branches is a feature built into Git.
> 
> But pull requests are a feature of GitHub.

Go ahead and submit a pull request with your mentor. Ask questions about the process, and make sure to see how the pull requests get merged.
