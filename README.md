Thank you for attending this Git-together.  We're very excited to share with you all about Git and GitHub!

# Before you get started

You'll want to have the following:

* a GitHub account
* Git installed
* Git-bash installed (if using Windows)

Please go to the install-desk if you don't have these already, so the fine people there can get you set up!
