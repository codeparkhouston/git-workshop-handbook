# Making new files

Let's make a new recipe!

{%mode mode="mentor" %}
> **Info** Keep an eye out for duplicate file names.  Try to prevent this so we avoid merge conflicts for now.  One way might be to plan together with the team as to who will add what types of recipes.
{%endmode %}

{%mode mode="mentor-cli" %}
> **Info** Keep an eye out for duplicate file names.  Try to prevent this so we avoid merge conflicts for now.  One way might be to plan together with the team as to who will add what types of recipes.
{%endmode %}

{%mode mode="cli" %}
Open the folder in your favorite text editor.
{%endmode %}

{%mode mode="s" %}
Find and click the "New file" button while on your branch on the project page.
{%endmode %}

Go ahead and create a new file, and add a simple recipe. Just for kicks, go ahead and put an obvious typo in there somewhere. Here's mine:
