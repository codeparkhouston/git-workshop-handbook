# Making an issue

What about the typos? Well, glad you mentioned that! We're going to use GitHub's **issue** system to make a report about the typo.

>Issues can be used to report bugs, request new features, and call to attention something else like slow performance - or a typo.

With the help of your mentor, report the typos on each other's recipes. It always helps to be descriptive when reporting bugs or suggesting changes. The more info you give, the faster it will be for someone to fix!
