# Fixing some issues

It's been called to our attention, so let's fix the typo. The process should now begin to become familiar to you. You'll need to:

* Create a new **branch**
* Make your edits
* **commit** your changes
* Make a **pull request**

{%mode mode="mentor" %}
> **Info** 
> Make your own branch and PR for one of the issues that another member is working on.  This will be for you to merge in last to demonstrate a merge conflict.
>
> This time, when you merge the pull request, put `closes #___` -- where __ is the issue number -- in the "Confirm Merge" message.  Show your team how the issue is now closed.
{%endmode %}
