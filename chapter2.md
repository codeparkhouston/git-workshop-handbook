# Today's exercise

To begin with, we'll be focusing on a simple example project, a recipe book. With this example, we'll learn *most* of the essentials that you'll need to manage your own projects with Git. 

Your group mentor will have started a project already for your group on GitHub<sup>*</sup>. Later in the day, you'll see how to create your own projects.

Your mentor will show you where the project is on GitHub, and add you as a collaborator. This will give you access to edit the project files.

<p style="color:purple"> CLI track: Your mentor will show you how to **clone** the project files to your own computer. </p>

<i>*</i> The difference between Git and GitHub will become more clear to you as the day progresses. For now, it's enough to know that GitHub is a place to store Git projects.
