# Fixing some issues

It's been called to our attention, so let's fix the typo. The process should now begin to become familiar to you. You'll need to:

* Create a new **branch**
* Make your edits
* **commit** your changes
* Make a **pull request**

{%mode mode="mentor" %}
> **Info** 
> Make your own branch and PR for one of the issues that another member is working on.  This will be for you to merge in last to demonstrate a merge conflict.
>
> This time, when you merge the pull request, put `closes #___` -- where __ is the issue number -- in the "Confirm Merge" message.  Show your team how the issue is now closed.
>
> When it comes to merging your PR, GitHub will have a message about how it can't merge since there's a conflict with master.  Explain to your team about how sometimes, we'll confuse git.  Resolve the conflict locally, and show your team how it's really just about helping git know what the file should actually look like.
