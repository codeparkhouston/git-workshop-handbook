# Rinse and repeat

Now let's recap what we've done so far. We have:

* Created a file
* Added the file (for CLI)
* Committed the change to our *branch*

Keep in mind that you can **git commit** more than one file together. 

Let's go ahead and add another recipe for practice. Repeat the process -*no need to add a typo this time*- and discuss with your mentor if you're unclear about what's happening in any of the steps.
