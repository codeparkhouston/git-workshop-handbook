# Getting the repo

To work on the project, we'll start by getting a copy of the repo on your computer.  We can do this by using git to **clone** the repo to your own computer.

{%mode mode="mentor-cli" %}
> **Info** Show your team how to `git clone` the recipe project.  Point out the messages git returns to be helpful.
{%endmode %}

{%mode mode="cli" %}
Once you have the project on your computer, you're ready to rock and roll.

# Branching

First thing we'll do is create a **branch** of our own to work on. A branch is a full copy of your project files. 


> **Comment** Why would you want to make a copy before you start making edits?
