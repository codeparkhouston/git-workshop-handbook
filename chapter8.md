# Making an issue

What about the typos? Well, glad you mentioned that! We're going to use GitHub's **issue** system to make a report about the typo.

>Issues can be used to report bugs, request new features, or - as we're doing now - call to attention something as simple as a typo.

With the help of your mentor, report typos on each other's recipes. It always helps to be descriptive when reporting bugs or suggesting changes. The more info you give, the faster it will be for someone to fix!
