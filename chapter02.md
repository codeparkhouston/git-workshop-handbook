# Today's exercise

To begin with, we'll be focusing on a simple example project, a recipe book. With this example, we'll learn *most* of the essentials that you'll need to manage your own projects with Git. 

Your group mentor will have a project started on GitHub<sup>*</sup> for your group to use in this exercise. Later in the day, you'll see how to create your own projects.

Your mentor will show you where the project is on GitHub, and add you as a collaborator. This will give you access to edit the project files.

>The project files are kept in folder Git is keeping track of, called a *Repository* - or *Repo* for short.

<p style="color:purple"> CLI track: Your mentor will show you how to <b>clone</b> the Repo to your own computer. </p>

<i>*</i> The difference between Git and GitHub will become more clear to you as the day progresses. For now, it's enough to know that GitHub is a place to store Git projects.
